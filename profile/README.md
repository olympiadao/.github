# 🏛️ Olympia Upgrade — Ethereum Classic Protocol Treasury

> **Decentralized, Permissionless, and Sustainable Funding for Ethereum Classic**

Olympia is the protocol upgrade that introduces a native treasury system to Ethereum Classic — enabling transparent, on-chain funding for public goods, infrastructure, and ecosystem growth, governed by code, not committees.

---

## 🔹 Overview

**Olympia** is a multi-phase protocol upgrade for Ethereum Classic that activates a decentralized treasury via a suite of ECIPs:

- **ECIP-1111**: Redirects `BASEFEE` from EIP-1559 into a treasury contract  
- **ECIP-1112**: Deploys the immutable Olympia Treasury smart contract  
- **ECIP-1113**: Defines the Olympia DAO governance framework  
- **ECIP-1114**: Establishes the decentralized funding proposal process (ECFP)

Together, these ECIPs provide a **modular, non-inflationary**, and **permissionless system** for sustainable protocol funding.

> **Status**: Open for community review and testing  
> **Planned Activation**: End of 2026 (after multi-stage testnets, audits, and review)

---

## 🔥 Why Olympia?

Ethereum Classic has operated for nearly a decade without a native development fund. This has led to:

- Team volatility and funding collapses
- Maintenance gaps (e.g., Core-Geth in maintenance mode)
- Centralization risks from off-chain grant programs

**Olympia is the solution — a self-sustaining, credibly neutral, on-chain funding mechanism that aligns with ETC’s founding values.**

## 🕯️ Symbolism: The Olympia Torch

The Olympia torch symbolizes:

- **Immutability** — The unforked flame of Ethereum Classic  
- **Sovereignty** — Freedom from centralized foundations or multisigs  
- **Proof-of-Work** — Real energy, real accountability  
- **Participation** — A torch is carried, not owned — just like Olympia governance

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

Olympia is grounded in Ethereum Classic's founding principles:

- **Code is Law**
- **Immutability is Integrity**
- **Neutrality is Strength**
- **Funding should be Permissionless**
